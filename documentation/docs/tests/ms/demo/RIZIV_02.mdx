## Description

See if software in test can handle temporary or definitive suspensions, as stated in [MS Cookbook](https://www.ehealth.fgov.be/standards/kmehr/file/cc73d96153bbd5448a56f19d925d05b1379c7f21/057e64396c1ea312a0b01607b0f94e4adcf456e8/20210331-safe_cookbook_medicatieschema_v5.8_en.pdf) 

## Files

- [XML file](/output/ms/RIZIV_02.xml)
- [Configuration file](https://github.com/smals-jy/KMEHR-tests/blob/main/configurations/ms/RIZIV_02.ts)

## Expected results

When looking to the patient medication scheme, for each scenario as stated in the following table   :
    - The medication must be present only the expected days
    - The software should warn users the last day before suspension (so that patients don't take the medication)
    - The suspension date & reason should be displayed (for example in the details of the medication)
