## Description

See if software in test can handle the formats of posologies possible in PCDH : 

```xml title="Example"
...
<model:dispensation>
    ...
    <model:administrationInstructions>
        <!-- Free text posology -->
        <model:posology>
            <!-- The focus on the test -->
        </model:posology>
        <!-- Codified posology -->
        <model:regimen>
            <!-- The focus on the test -->
        </model:regimen>
    </model:administrationInstructions>
    ...
</model:dispensation>
...
```

## Test cases

- posology (free-text)
- No administrationInstructions
- Regimen (one line)
- Regimen (multiple lines)

## Files

- [XML file](https://github.com/smals-jy/KMEHR-tests/blob/main/output/pcdh/TS-04-posology-formats.xml)
- [Configuration file](https://github.com/smals-jy/KMEHR-tests/blob/main/configurations/pcdh/TS-04-posology-formats.ts)

## Expected results 

When looking to the patient delivered medication history : 
- Medication with name "Posology - TC 1" has this as posology : "administrationInstructions - posology (free-text)"
- Medication with name "Posology - TC 2" has no posology
- Medication with name "Posology - TC 3" has a single line posology
  - "Take 42 * 5 ml	between breakfast and lunch", translated in user language (as it is codified)
- Medication with name "Posology - TC 4" has a two lines posology
  - "Take 42 * 5 ml	 between breakfast and lunch", translated in user language (as it is codified)
  - "Take 25 * 5 ml after dinner", translated in user language (as it is codified)
